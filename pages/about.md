# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
An avid software developer from India who enjoys creating and working on programs that actually help simplify the work of others. And I'm currently pursuing computer enginering from VIT in India.

Here are the few things I enjoy doing :-
1. Striking a balance between the quality of the code and time.
2. Learning something new from the communities over Github and StackOverflow.
3. Sharing and receiving knowledge thanks to open source.
4. Obviously, coding.
5. Spending time with my family and friends.
